## What is a Trojan? ##

A Trojan is a program that infects a victim machine and gives control to an 
attacker by misleading a user into downloading it as a legitimate file. 
Modern trojans are loaded by other programs and gain persistence on the system 
allowing a malicious party to spy on the user, damage the system, steal 
sensitive information, or add the computer to a botnet.

### What is a RAT? ###

A RAT, or Remote Access Tool/Trojan, is a type of malware that gives Administrative 
control to another user, and provides a covert backdoor to the system. This 
allows the remote user to do anything from keylogging, taking screenshots, 
changing network settings, or spy on the user via their webcam or microphone.

### What is a Stealer? ###

A Stealer is a type of malware that is explicitly used to steal information from 
a user, such as bank info, logins, and other sensitive files. Stealers are typically 
a bit less sophisticated than other malware, and often times not include some of 
the more advanced persistence techiques of other malware. 

## Mitigations ##

Mitigations vary from system to system, but the core security principles apply 
to each of them. Having a good antivirus, and using proper care when downloading 
files from unknown sources will prevent a large number of attacks on users.

## Navigating the Repo ##

The repo is divided into several folders, containing specific categories of 
activity.

Zip files may have the same or similar names, so each filename contains an 
identifier based on the first 6 characters of the SHA1 hash of the file. 
The formula is:

    FILENAME.SHA1.EXTENSION

Non Zip files may contain this naming pattern as well.
